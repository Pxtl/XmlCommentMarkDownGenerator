Contributing
This is a side-project by Martin Zarate (aka Pxtl), and so any contributions in the form 
of bug reports and fixes are appreciated.  Realistically, as a side-project with very 
limited developer hours, the most effective way to fix a bug is to develop a fix yourself
and pull-request it into the project for others to use.

Issues

Bugs or anomalies in the behavior of this program, issues with its installation, requests 
for changes in documentation, design and development issues, and feature requests will 
be tracked via GitHub's Issues mechanism.

When reporting a bug, please provide the following info if appropriate:
    What are the steps to reproduce the bug?  If possible, the simplest such set of steps 
        is best.
    Does the bug still happen using the latest version?
    What PxtlCa.XmlCommentMarkDownGenerator version and OS are you using?

Submitting a Pull Request

Pull Requests are welcome, however code-quality will be maintained.  While project grew 
out of a code snippet that used a somewhat unusual pattern and code quality is as such 
somewhat low, it will not be allowed to get worse.  Code will be nitpicked, and large 
rewrites or huge features dumped in all at once will likely be blocked.
